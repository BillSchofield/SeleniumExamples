Introduction to Selenium Webdriver
==================================

## Using WebDriver to find WebElements using Locators
Examine and run each of the unit tests in FindElementUsingLocators. This should give you some sense of how to locate
WebElements and use them. Note that these examples are not proper tests and are named for the Selenium features they
demonstrate. They also are not using the Page Object Pattern.

Implement each of the tests in AmazonShoppingTests. Use BDD-style tests and Page Object Pattern.
